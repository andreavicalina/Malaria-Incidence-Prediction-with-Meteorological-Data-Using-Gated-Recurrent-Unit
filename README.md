# Malaria Incidence Prediction with Meteorological Data Using Gated Recurrent Unit
## Introduction
In this project, i employed the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to forecast time series steps and sequences by leveraging meteorological data. Additionally, the developed model was deployed using Streamlit. 

## Getting Started
To run this repo, be sure to install the following environment and library:

Python==3.11.4

Keras==2.13.1 

Streamlit==1.26.0

Matplotlib==3.7.1

Pandas==1.5.3

Numpy==1.24.3

Tensorflow==2.13.0

Scipy==1.10.1
